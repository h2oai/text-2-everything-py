## Download the SDK

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/h2oai/text-2-everything-py/releases) page.

## Install

```bash
pip install h2o_text_2_everything-0.1.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

Replace `0.1.x` with the version number from the release (e.g., `0.1.2`, `0.1.3`, etc.)

## Future (PyPI)

Once published to PyPI, you'll be able to install directly:

```bash
pip install h2o-text-2-everything
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.9 or higher is installed
- **Proxy Settings**: If behind a proxy, set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables
- **Latest Version**: Check the [Releases](https://github.com/h2oai/text-2-everything-py/releases) page for the newest version
